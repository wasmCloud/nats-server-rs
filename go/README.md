# Rust NATS Server - Go FFI Wrapper
This is a thin Go application that, when compiled into a shared or static library, provides an FFI-friendly wrapper around the various Go-based NATS constructs and functions.

This code isn't used directly, it provides a shared or static _library_ for use by the [Rust](../rust) crate in this repository.
